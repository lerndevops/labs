Get the current storage driver:
	docker info

Two ways we can set the storage drivers

	1) Set the storage driver explicitly by providing a flag to the Docker daemon:
		 sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
		 Edit the ExecStart line, adding the --storage-driver devicemapper flag:
		 ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --storage-driver devicemapper ...
		 After any edits to the unit file, reload Systemd and restart Docker:

		 sudo systemctl daemon-reload
		 sudo systemctl restart docker


	2) We can also set the storage driver explicitly using the daemon configuration file. 
	   This is the method that Docker recommends. 
	   Note that we cannot do this and pass the --storage-driver flag to the daemon at the same time

	sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
	Set the storage driver in the daemon configuration file:

		{
			"storage-driver": "devicemapper"
		}
	Restart Docker after editing the file. 
	It is also a good idea to make sure Docker is running properly after changing the configuration file:

	sudo systemctl restart docker
	sudo systemctl status docker
